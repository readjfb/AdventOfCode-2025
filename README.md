# Advent Of Code 2025
I'm uploading my solutions to each day here for my own sake! I'll be working in Python 3, though I might try out some other languages if I get bored.

## Goals
1. Complete as many days as possible without the use of AI tools or looking at external solutions
2. Get the runtime of part 1 + part 2 to be under 1 second, or as close to it as possible
3. Make it to Day 9 at least!
4. Get as many points as possible

## Times
My goal is to get each day to run in sub 1 second on my laptop (M4 Pro) for parts 1 and 2 combined.

| Day  | Time in ms* | Time goal  | No AI use? |
| ---: | :-------: | :--------: | :-------:|
| **1**  | 2       |  ✅        | ✅    |
| **2**  | 823     |  ✅        | ✅    |
| **3**  | 4       |  ✅        | ✅    |
| **4**  | 198     |  ✅        | ✅    |
| **5**  | 3       |  ✅        | ✅    |
| **6**  | 4       |  ✅        | ✅    |
| **7**  | 6       |  ✅        | ✅    |
| **8**  | 283     |  ✅        | ✅    |
