# Advent Of Code 2025
I'm uploading my solutions to each day here for my own sake! I'll be working in Python 3, though I might try out some other languages if I get bored.

## Goals
1. Complete as many days as possible without the use of AI tools or looking at external solutions
2. Get the runtime of part 1 + part 2 to be under 1 second, or as close to it as possible
3. Make it to Day 9 at least!
4. Get as many points as possible!
